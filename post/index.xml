      <description>Analyzed a file containing demographic data and answered various questions about demographic trends in the data. Inspected the data and found that the sample population consisted mostly of people who were white, male, and between 28 and 38 years old and had at least a high school diploma. Less than a quarter of the sample earned a yearly salary greater than 50K. Plotted data at various levels of analysis to visualize findings.</description>

      <description>Implemented and applied principle component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and the k-means algorithm to conduct unsupervised machine learning on data. Extracted and cleaned two datasets to test the algorithms. The first data set was gene expression data from cancer patients. The second was response data from an online version of the Depression and Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS). Evaluated the algorithms&amp;rsquo; results by plotting the k-means-defined clusters of the PCA-reduced data and calculating the inertia.</description>

      <title>Project 1: Language Prediction</title>

      <description>Used trigram frequencies to predict the language of one or more documents based on a sample of documents where the language is known. Calculated normalized vectors of the trigram counts for the known documents in each language and used cosin similarity to compare them to the vectorized unknown documents. Returned results as a text file with probabilities for each included language. Accurately predicted the language of all tested documents, even with small samples.</description>
